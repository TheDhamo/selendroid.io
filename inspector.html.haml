      %h1#gettingStarted Selendroid Inspector
      %p Selendroid comes with a useful little tool called Selendroid Inspector. It’s a little web app which is embedded inside your selendroid test server. Its purpose is to let you inspect the current state of your app’s UI.</p>

        %li UI screenshot with view locator
        %li Record the click actions
        %li Display the source html of a web view
        %li XPath helper

      %h3 Where do I get it?
      %p When you have started selendroid-standalone and you have started a test session, you can find the web app at: <a href="http://localhost:5555/inspector">http://localhost:5555/inspector</a>
      %h2#webviewSourceCode Web View Source Code
      %p For displaying the html source code of a web view please follow these steps:
      %ul
        %li Select in the UI hierarchy the webview you want to inspect and press the <code>ctrl</code> key (this keeps the selection of the element).
        %li select the tab <em>Html Source</em>
      %h2#recorder Test Case Recorder
      %p Selendroid Inspector has a simple build in test case recorder that tries to identify the element that is clicked (on the screenshot) and saves the locator and click command into the <em>Java</em> tab.
